<h1>THE PLANE TREE </h1>
<p>Two Travellers, walking in the noonday sun, sought the shade of a widespreading tree to rest. As they lay looking up among the pleasant leaves, they saw that it was a Plane Tree.</p>

<em>"How useless is the Plane!" said one of them. "It bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter the ground with leaves."</em>

<strong>"Ungrateful creatures!" said a voice from the Plane Tree. "You lie here in my cooling shade, and yet you say I am useless! Thus ungratefully, O Jupiter, do men receive their blessings!"</strong><br/>

Our best blessings are often the least appreciated.
